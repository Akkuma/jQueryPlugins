jQuery Late Loader

Enables late loading of javascript/css files.

Created especially for the scenario of having multiple dynamic controls on a page that may need the same resources.
See the sample for more details..

Includes error handling for missing files.

Currently lacking support for recognizing errors in remote (not from the same domain) css files for non IE browsers.
